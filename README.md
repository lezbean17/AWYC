## Project Management
The Projects tab will contain project management plans, each project can have it's own board.

Current thoughts on tasks:
1. Create a committee / main organization body
2. Outline our goals, demands, and actions we are going to take
3. Produce a website and social media accounts

As far as I can tell you have to have a Github account for me to give you access. Send me a message with your Github username and I'll add you (discord is lezbean17)
